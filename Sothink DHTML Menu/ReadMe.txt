DESCRIPTION

	Sothink DHTML Menu can help web designers to create professional 
	DHTML pop-up menu for web pages without writing a single line 
	of code. It doesn't require the designer to have any DHTML or 
	JavaScript experience. 

	Sothink DHTML Menu generates robust code to fit for different 
	web browsers. The menu can automatically detect the visitors' 
	browser	type and load the best script code for it, so the 
	designers could	be free of caring the browser compatibility 
	problems. The supported browsers include IE, Netscape and Opera. 
	The pop-up menu can have multiple levels. It can be fully 
	customizable by changing the text, font, link, background, 
	bullets, border style, pop-up effect and so on. The designer 
	can put the menu to relative position or absolute position, 
	so the menu can be easily inserted at any place in the web page.

	Sothink DHTML Menu provides many pre-made effects, themes and 
	templates, so the design doesn't need to start from scratch 
	and will be easier. The designer can also create his/her own 
	themes or templates. Sothink DHTML Menu also includes other 
	features such as just-in-time preview, publish wizard. And 
	it can work stand alone, work with MS FrontPage seamlessly 
	as an add-in, work with Dreamweaver as an extension program
	or work with Sothink HTML Editor as a web widget.
